Hi Mahesh I saw that you are on holidays so not sure if you will check my assignment but still here is some information about my work.

I have focused on test stability they are fully stable (10/10 runs fully passed last time I checked).

The framework itself is not the best, it still needs some work to do like adjusting hooks, better driver management and adding scenario context would also be nice.
But in the time frame I spent on this project I wasn't able to do it.

Also you asked me on the interview about xpaths so I thought this are the locators that you would like me to use but in the word file there is this sentence:
"Structured well using best coding practices" and using xpaths is not always the best practice but as I started that way I wanted to be consistent till the end,
and in my tests I used Thread.Sleep once which is a very bad practice and there is some code repetition but I didn't had enough time to deal with it.

To run the tests just download the repo to visual studio, build solution, and run tests through test explorer.
