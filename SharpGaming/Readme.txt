Hi Mahesh I hope you are doing great!

So here is the framework I've created its far from perfect but for the 4 days of work im pretty happy with what I have done.

You asked me about xpaths on our interview so I thought that you would like for me to use them, but then after reading again the word file
point "Structured well using best coding practices" using xpath is not the best/most sufficient way of receiving data from DOM but as I started that way
I wanted to be consistent to the end and again the time factor is not allowing me to change this approach.

I'll send you the link to this repo tomorrow( 17.12)( I still need to finish the IrishLotto scenario) and even as you gave me time to 19.12 I can't spend the weekend working on this because I have o 6 month old son
and as much as I would like to join sharp gaming I would like not to be killed by my fiance for not helping her with my boy.
